                            <h3>Early Life</h3>
                            <p>Frédéric François Chopin was born on March 1, 1810, in Żelazowa Wola, a village in the Duchy of Warsaw. His father, Nicolas Chopin, was a French-expatriate who worked as a tutor, and his mother, Tekla Justyna Krzyżanowska, was Polish. Chopin's musical talents manifested early—he began playing the piano at age four and composing at six.</p>

                            <h3>Education and Early Career</h3>
                            <p>Chopin studied at the Warsaw Conservatory under Józef Elsner. During these years, he developed his distinctive style, blending the traditions of Polish folk music with Classical forms. By the time he completed his studies, he had already composed important works including his two piano concertos.</p>

                            <h3>Move to Paris</h3>
                            <p>After the failed Polish November Uprising against Russian rule, Chopin left Poland, ultimately settling in Paris. He would never return to his homeland. In Paris, Chopin quickly established himself among the musical elite, befriending other prominent composers like Franz Liszt and Hector Berlioz.</p>

                            <h3>George Sand Years</h3>
                            <p>Chopin's relationship with the writer Amantine Lucile Aurore Dupin (known by her pen name, George Sand) was one of the most significant in his life. Their winters in Majorca and summers at Sand's country estate in Nohant were productive periods for Chopin, during which he composed many of his most renowned works.</p>

                            <h3>Final Years</h3>
                            <p>After his relationship with Sand ended, Chopin's health deteriorated rapidly. He made a final concert tour to England and Scotland in 1848, but returned to Paris severely weakened. Frédéric Chopin died on October 17, 1849, at the age of 39, most likely from tuberculosis. His funeral at the Church of the Madeleine was attended by nearly 3,000 people, where Mozart's Requiem was performed at his request.</p>

                    <h2 class="section-title">Musical Legacy</h2>
                    <p>Chopin transformed piano music through technical innovations and emotional depth. Unlike many contemporaries, he rarely performed in public, preferring intimate settings. His compositions—predominantly for solo piano—revolutionized the instrument's expressive capabilities.</p>
                    
                    <div class="highlight-item">
                        <h3>Innovation in Form</h3>
                        <p>Chopin expanded existing forms like the nocturne, waltz, and mazurka while creating distinctive interpretations of classical structures like the sonata. He pioneered the ballade as a musical form and transformed the étude from a mere technical exercise into a work of artistic merit.</p>

                        <h3>Technical Contributions</h3>
                        <p>His approach to piano technique emphasized flexibility, nuance, and a singing tone. Chopin's interest in counterpoint and harmonies influenced not only his contemporaries but generations of future composers, from Liszt to Debussy and beyond.</p>
